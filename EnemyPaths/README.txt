loopingPath.tres: designed as an early stage. Whole path is visable from the default camera angle, and is curvey. However: it does self-intersect.

starPath.tres: designed as a lategame stage. Lots of self-intersection, and impossible to see the whole thing at once. Saving grace is that it's long.

circularPath.tres: designed as a lategame stage. No intersection, but impossible to see all at once and very short.

starPath.tres + circularPath.tres: both of these are designed to be together in one stage--styled like an old-timey Sheriff's badge. Perhaps titled "Howdy, Sheriff" to clue the player in?

Spiral.tres: designed as a late-stage game. Potentially can be remixed and combined with other levels?
