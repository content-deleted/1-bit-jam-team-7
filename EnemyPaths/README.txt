loopingPath.tres: designed as an early stage. Whole path is visable from the default camera angle, and is curvey. However: it does self-intersect.

starPath.tres: designed as a lategame stage. Lots of self-intersection, and impossible to see the whole thing at once. Saving grace is that it's long.

circularPath.tres: designed as a lategame stage. No intersection, but impossible to see all at once and very short.

starPath.tres + circularPath.tres: both of these are designed to be together in one stage--styled like an old-timey Sheriff's badge. Perhaps titled "Howdy, Sheriff" to clue the player in?

Spiral.tres: designed as a late-stage game. Potentially can be remixed and combined with other levels?

ACABPath.tres: ...this one's mostly for fun, tbh. It's got lots of places where the enemies walk the same path twice, which could make for extra double damage chances for AoE stuff, plus it's rather long so there's lots of chances for the player to do well. Story-wise this level might be justified if Alic is somehow controlling the path in-universe but that's just flavor text to justify something silly. Maybe a secret bonus stage for if you beat the main mode with some crazy strategy like using fewer than 4 non-light towers?
